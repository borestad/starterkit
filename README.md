# What is this?

This is a small sample repository that uses Babel to transform TypeScript to plain JavaScript, and uses TypeScript for type-checking.

# How do I use it?

## Building the repo

```sh
yarn build
```

## Type-checking the repo

```sh
yarn typecheck
```

And to run in `--watch` mode:

```sh
yarn typecheck:watch
```
